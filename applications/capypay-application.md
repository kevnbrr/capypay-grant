## üåü Project Overview

![CapyPay Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/077d0c49-d3b8-4a16-8e79-b362bf61e8e0)

**CapyPay** aims to start as a crowdfunding website allowing creators to receive funding on-chain for their projects (both digital and physical) by people who truly support their vision. We will provide lower fees compared to KickStarter, the go-to web2 competitor, and provide creators with the opportunity to KYC (which should increase the trust of the donnors and lead to increased donations).   

### üîç Project Details

Project Overview

One-liner: **"Kickstarter on chain!"**

**Description:** Creators launch campaigns with funding goals and specific milestones. Backer's will donate to these campaigns. Once the campaign is fully funded, the creators will receive gradualy payouts once a milestone is comleted. The platform will require a minimum of 2 milestones per campaign to prevent creators from rugging and running away with 100% of the donated funds. 

**Technical Stack**
  Hosting: Vercel 
  Frontend: Next.js + React, Polkadot.js API for blockchain interactions 
  Smart Contracts: ink! on Substrate Contracts

**What will be completed:**
- Completed front-end with full users functionality allowing the user to fund campaigns
  - Users will also be able to create campaigns, set campaign goals (including milestones), upload photos (1-5) to support the campaign, and upload a YouTube video if needed
- Completed backend system that handles user signup/login, securely store user data and campaign data, smart contract integration to ensure the frontend properly displays the funding goal (at or near real-time)
- Smart contracts will be completed and launched on testnet
- Twitter will be created and be posting

**What will not be completed at the current stage:**
- Mainnet deploymented (may be deployed but depends on the launch fees so TBD)
- No cross-chain functionality at the current stage
- No on/off-ramp functionality (users will be directed to reputable CEXs) 

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? The platform would result in increased transactions on Polkadot and onboard more users.  
- Who is your target audience? Creators who have a product (digital or physical) but lack the funding to pursue their idea. 
- What need(s) does your project meet? It provides creators of all types the opportunity to make their product/ideas become reality. 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem? Yes but they are more focused in the gaming sector of crowdfunding. Our platform would be open to all creators, however, aims to be more like KickStarter by allowing for physical products to be launched.

- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (maximum $10,000 USD)


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Code released under MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can utilize the webapp (e.g. signup, connect wallet, launch and donnate to a campaign) |
| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness, which includes covering contract logic and frontend flows. |
| 0d. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. The article will include a video demo of the webapp. |
| 1. | Setup & Soft-Launch | Build landing page & about us page, integrate waitlist form and logic to capture emails from interested users on the landing page, set-up X profile for CapyPay and post once per week, buy and connect domain to web hosting provider. |
| 2. | Frontend & Marketing | Complete frontend including: main page, campaign listings/search, campaign overview and details (for donors), user profile, and campaign statistics (for creators). Integrate wallet connection for transactions and profile creation. Post 4 times per week on X from the company's X profile to highlight progress and real world use case.  |
| 3. | Contracts & Demo | Develop, test, and deploy smart contracts on testnet ensuring the escrow mechanism (e.g. user donation, milestone based payouts to creators, platform fees) work properly. Record and publish final demo video on X showcasing the work completed and officially announcing that the platform is now live for anyone to use. |

### üí∞ Budget Breakdown

Budget breakdown by milestone:

| Milestone | Deliverables | Cost (USD) | Estimated Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0a‚Äì0d, Feature 1 | $2,500 | 4 weeks |
| 2 | Feature 2 | $3,500 | 1 month |
| 3 | Feature 3 | $4,000 | 1 month |
| **Total** | All Deliverables | **$10,000** | **3 months** |

## üîÆ Future Plans

**- Mainnet Launch:** Deploy escrow contracts on a Polkadot mainnet.

**- Ecosystem Growth:** Partner with creator communities and incubators to drive on‚Äëchain crowdfunding adoption.

**- Secure Funding:** Apply for further funding (either from web3 foundations or VCs) to further pursue this project.

**- Marketing:** Launch consistent marketing campaigns and collaborations to increase mindshare and expand outside the Polkadot community/audience.

**- Additional Monetization:** To increase platform revenue, we would offer creators the option to KYC for a flat one time fee per campaign, which would increase the likelihood of users donating to their campaign. We would also offer to boost a creator's campaign for a percentage of the money raised while their campaign was boosted or of their total campaign goal (tbd). 

**- Goals:** Cross chain payments, B2B payments system, Collateralized micro‚Äëloans, tipping and bill‚Äësplitting modules (expand into the payments category while using the crowdfunding platform as one way to onboard new users).
  
  Reasoning: CapyPay is a generic name which allows us the opportunity to expand into the broader payments category, which has seen a growing demand. Therefore, providing us the flexibility to capture the payments and DeFi sector on Polkadot while not limiting our offerings to the users.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

- Work Completed to Date: Quickly prototyped frontends and smart contracts on Solana's testnet
- Funding: First time applying for funding to any ecosystem for a project idea because this idea is something I'm genuinely passionate about continuing on after the grant with hopes of expanding into the payments sector.
